Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed. My interior world needs to sanitize.
Nice to know my kind will be on my side, I don't believe the hype.
I'll stay awake 'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.
I don't hear those voices calling, I must have kicked them out.
Why won't you let me go. Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant.
I'm so afraid of what you have to say 'Cause I am quiet now and silence gives you space.
When everyone you thought you knew Deserts your fight, I'll go with you.
Wonderin' would you be my little quarantine? Or is this the way it ends?
